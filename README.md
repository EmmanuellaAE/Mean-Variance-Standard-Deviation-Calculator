# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator.
As part of the Free Code Camp bootcamp, I have been tasked to create a mean-variance-standard deviation calculator.
This is to demonstrate that I have a good foundational knowledge of data analysis in Python.
This Calculator is a python function.
It has been made to accept only nine digits.
The function first converts the list into a 3by3 matrix.
The library used is Numpy
